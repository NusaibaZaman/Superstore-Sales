# Superstore-Sales

The following project aims to explore and analyze data trends within the dataset for Superstore sales. Through visualization and plotting of bar charts, we can infer that California was the state with the most orders and Wyoming with the least. The category which was the most ordered was office supplies and binders were the most popular item ordered in sub-categories. We can also see that California generated the highest total sales amount and North Dakota generated the least amount in total sales. The category for Technology generated the highest amount in sales with Phones generating the most amount in sales for sub-categories. The Consumer segment had the highest number of orders and also the highest amount in sales. Lastly, the total yearly sales have increased significantly over the years from 2017 to 2019, but had dropped from 2016 to 2017.
